## Prerequisites

Python: The script is written in Python, so you'll need Python installed on your system.

Tkinter: This is the GUI library used for the application. It's usually included with Python installations.

Requests library: Used for making HTTP requests to fetch token data.

PyCoingecko library: Used to interact with the CoinGecko API for additional token information.

Internet connection: Required to fetch real-time data from DexScreener and CoinGecko APIs.

Basic understanding of Solana blockchain and tokens: While not strictly necessary to run the application, it would be helpful for interpreting the results.

To install the required Python libraries, you can use pip:

pip install requests pycoingecko

Note that you may need to prefix this command with 'python -m' or 'python3 -m' depending on your system configuration.
